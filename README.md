Most of theses frogs are based on the SVGs of the twitter emoji set (https://twemoji.twitter.com). Others are unique designs with other inspirations in mind.

Have fun using them! üê∏

-a, --all                       Generate PNGs of all SVGs.
-s, --specific S [S ...]        Generate PNGs for each S in the "svg" folder. The '.svg' suffix is optional.
-r, --resolution R [R ...]      Custom resolutions that will be generated instead of the defaults.
